Diamond-free Degree Sequences

Given a simple undirected graph G = (V,E), where V is the set of vertices and E
the set of undirected edges, the edge {u,v} is in E if and only if vertex u is
adjacent to vertex v in G. The graph is simple in that there are no loop edges,
i.e. we have no edges of the form {v,v}. Each vertex v in V has a degree dv i.e.
the number of edges incident on that vertex. Consequently a graph has a degree
sequence d1,...,dn, where di >= di+1. A diamond is a set of four vertices in V
such that there are at least five edges between those vertices. Conversely, a
graph is diamond-free if it has no diamond as an induced subgraph, i.e. for
every set of four vertices the number of edges between those vertices is at
most four.

In our problem we have additional properties required of the degree sequences
of the graphs, in particular that the degree of each vertex is greater than
zero (i.e. isolated vertices are disallowed), the degree of each vertex is
modulo 3, and the sum of the degrees is modulo 12 (i.e. |E| is modulo 6).

The problem is then for a given value of n, produce all unique degree sequences
d1,...,dn such that

di >= di+1 each degree di >= 0 and di is modulo 3 the sum of the degrees is
modulo 12 there exists a simple diamond-free graph with that degree sequence
Below, as an example, is the unique degree sequence for n=10 along with the
adjacency matrix of a diamond-free graph with that degree sequence.
