Construct two n x n matrices such that the determinant of the first matrix is one and the determinant of the
second matrix is either one or minus one.
The elements of the diagonal of the first matrix must be not equal to one or minus one.
Moreover, the elements of the second matrix are the squares of the elements of the first matrix.
