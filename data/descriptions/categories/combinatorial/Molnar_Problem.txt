Molnar's Problem

Molnar originally posed the following problem to construct two k x k matrices
such that the determinant of the first matrix is one and the determinant of the
second matrix (composed by squares of the elements of the first matrix) is
either 1 or -1.
where the elements on the diagonal are integers not equal to plus or minus 1, and `det' denotes the
determinant of a matrix. The solutions to this problem are significant in
classifying certain types of topological spaces. Guy discusses a variant where
0 entries are also disallowed and the sign of both determinants must be
positive.
