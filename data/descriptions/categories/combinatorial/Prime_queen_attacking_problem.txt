Prime queen attacking problem

This problem, posed first by G.L. Honaker, is to put a queen and the n^2
numbers 1,...,n^2, on a n x n chessboard so that: (a) no two numbers are on the
same cell, (b) any number i+1 is reachable by a knight move from the cell
containing i, (c) the number of "free" primes (i.e., primes not attacked by the
queen) is minimal.  Note that 1 is not prime, and that the queen does not
attack its own cell.
