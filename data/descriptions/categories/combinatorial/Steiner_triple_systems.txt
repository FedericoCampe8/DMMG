Steiner triple systems

The ternary Steiner problem of order n consists of finding a set of n.(n-1)/6
triples of distinct integer elements in {1,ï¿½,n} such that any two triples have
at most one common element. It is a hypergraph problem coming from
combinatorial mathematics [Lueneburg 1989] where n modulo 6 has to be equal to
1 or 3 [Lindner and Rosa 1980]. One possible solution for n=7 is {{1, 2, 3},
{1, 4, 5}, {1, 6, 7}, {2, 4, 6}, {2, 5, 7}, {3, 4, 7}, {3, 5, 6}}. The solution
contains 7*(7-1)/6 = 7 triples.

This is a particular case of the more general Steiner system.

More generally still, you may refer to Balanced Incomplete Block Designs (BIBD:
prob028). In fact, a Steiner Triple System with n elements is a BIBD(n,
n.(n-1)/6, (n-1)/2, 3, 1).
