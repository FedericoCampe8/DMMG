Given the twelve standard pitch classes, represented by numbers, find a series in which each pitch class occurs exactly once and in which the musical intervals between neighboring notes cover the full set of intervals from the minor second to the major seventh. 
That is, for each of the intervals, there is a pair of neighboring pitch classes in the series, between which this interval appears.
