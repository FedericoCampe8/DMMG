Fixed Length Error Correcting Codes

A fixed length error correcting code C of length n over an alphabet F is a set
of strings from Fn. Given two strings from Fn we can define the distance
between them. The most commonly used distance is the Hamming distance, defined
as the number of positions where the strings differ. Using this we define the
minimum distance of C as the minimum of the distances between distinct pairs of
strings from C.  There are a number of other distances which can be used, for
example the 'Lee distance'. When F={0,1,...,n-1} the Lee distance between a,b
in F is defined as min(|a-b|,n-|a-b|). For two vectors x and y defined over Fn,
the Lee distance is calculated by summing the lee distance of the pairs xi, yi.
Most commonly F={0,1,2,3} as this case proves useful in a number of areas.
