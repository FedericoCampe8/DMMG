Minimum Energy Broadcast (MEB)

This benchmark specification originates from the Centre for Telecommunications
Value-chain Research and Cork Constraint Computation Centre, Dept. of Computer
Science, University College Cork, Ireland. This work is supported by Science
Foundation Ireland under Grant No. 03/CE3/I405.  An ad hoc network is a
collection of wireless devices that form a network without any centralised
infrastructure. When the devices are deployed they must first configure
themselves to form a correctly functioning network. One configuration task when
operating in a battery limited environment is the Minimum Energy Broadcast
(MEB) problem. Assume a network of devices with omnidirectional antennas. The
aim is to configure the power level in each device such that if a specified
source device broadcasts a message it will reach every other device either
directly or by being retransmitted by an intermediate device (a broadcast tree
is formed). The desired configuration is that which minimises the total energy
required by all devices, thus increasing the lifetime of the network.

Several approaches (both centralised and distributed) have been proposed for
solving this problem. See the references page of this benchmark for more
information. As there is no central controller and in a large network
centralising the entire problem may be infeasible, Distributed Constraint
Optimisation (DisCOP) is one appropriate way to model and solve the problem,
and it is this approach that will be described in this specification.

DisCOP Formulation

To formulate the problem as a DisCOP, we have an agent, ai, representing each
device in the network. The neighbours of ai include all agents that ai can
communicate with when broadcasting at its maximum power level.

Relationship variables: For each neighbour aj, ai has a public variable, taking
one of 3 values, indicating the relationship between the two devices in the
current solution (broadcast tree):

0 = the devices are not connected in the broadcast tree 1 = ai is the parent of
aj in the broadcast tree 2 = ai is the child of aj in the broadcast tree An
inter-agent constraint between each pair of neighbours ensures that the
corresponding variables in neighbouring nodes match up correctly, i.e. both are
0, or else one is 1 and the other is 2. To construct a tree, each agent is
constrained to have exactly one parent, except the source device, which is not
allowed any parents.  Power/energy variables:The agents also have a private
variable corresponding to each of these public variables set to be the energy
cost incurred due to the setting of that public variable, i.e. if the public
variable is 1 then the private variable is assigned the energy cost for
broadcasting to that neighbour, otherwise it is assigned 0. A private
constraint over all of these `energy cost' variables states the total cost for
ai to broadcast to all of its children is the maximum of these costs.

Hop-count variable:Each agent also has a hop-count variable, indicating how
many hops that device is from the source device. A second inter-agent
constraint between neighbouring agents ensures that the hop-count of a child in
the broadcast tree is one greater than its parent, thus preventing cycles.

Example

Figure 1 displays an example MEB problem with 10 devices. This problem is
modelled using the variables as specified in Table 1 and constraints as
described in the previous paragraph. Its corresponding minimal energy broadcast
tree is shown in Figure 2, and the optimal assignments to variables is shown in
Table 2.

 

Table 1. Complete list of variables and domains of all agents in the problem.
Variable names begin with the agent name. Subscript 'h' indicates hop count
variable; 'r' indicates relationship variable; 'p' indicates broadcast
power/energy cost variable. For relationship variables, -x indicates that
variable is for the relationship with agent x. Similarly for energy cost
variables, the -x indicates that this is the power required to reach agent x.

Problem Parameters

Specific problem instances are included in this benchmark and are linked to on
the main benchmark page.  Problems can also be generated using the following
parameters:

An area with length x and width y in which to place the devices.  A number n of
devices.  A maximum power p at which each device can broadcast at.  A path loss
exponent exp, which is the rate at which the radio signal attenuates.  Each
device is placed randomly in the area. To determine the power required for two
devices a1 and a2 to communicate with each other, first calculate the distance,
d between the devices: d = âˆš((x2-x1)2 + (y2-y1)2). The energy used (w=watts) to
broadcast this distance is: w = (dexp) x 0.0001. If w < p, then the devices can
communicate.  Notes

This problem is related to the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) and Minimum
Spanning Tree (MST) problem. The key difference with the TSP is that in MEB the
salesman/broadcast can travel more than one route out of a city/node. The
difference with the Minimum Spanning Tree problem comes from the fact that the
cost of broadcasting to multiple child nodes is the maximum cost over all the
links to children as opposed to the sum of the links.
