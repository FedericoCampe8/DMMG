Steel Mill Slab Design

Steel is produced by casting molten iron into slabs. A steel mill can produce a
finite number, Ïƒ, of slab sizes. An order has two properties, a colour
corresponding to the route required through the steel mill and a weight. Given
d input orders, the problem is to assign the orders to slabs, the number and
size of which are also to be determined, such that the total weight of steel
produced is minimised. This assignment is subject to two further constraints:
Capacity constraints: The total weight of orders assigned to a slab cannot
exceed the slab capacity.  Colour constraints: Each slab can contain at most p
of k total colours (p is usually 2).  The colour constraints arise because it
is expensive to cut up slabs in order to send them to different parts of the
mill.  The above description is a simplification of a real industrial problem
(see [1]). For example, the problem may also include inventory matching, where
surplus stock can be used to fulfil some of the orders.
