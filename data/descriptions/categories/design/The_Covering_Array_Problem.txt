The Covering Array Problem

The covering array problem is formulated as follows.

A covering array CA(t,k,g) of size b and strength t, is a k x b array A =
(a_{ij}) over Z_g = {0,1,2,...,g-1} with the property that for any t distinct
rows 1 <= r_1 <= r_2 <= ... <= r_t <= k, and any member (x_1, x_2, ..., x_t) of
Z^t_g there exists at least one column c such that x_i equals the (r_i,c)-th
element of A for all 1 <= i <= t.

A covering array number CAN(t,k,g) is the smallest b such that there exists a
CA(t,k,g) of size b.

Informally, any t distinct rows of the covering array must encode column-wise
all numbers from 0 to g^t-1 (repititions are allowed).

The problem comes from hardware and software testing.
