Warehouse Location Problem

In the Warehouse Location problem (WLP),ï¿½ a company considers opening warehouses
at some candidate locations in order to supply its existing stores. Each possible warehouse
has the same maintenance cost, and a capacity designating the maximum number of stores
that it can supply. Each store must be supplied by exactly one open warehouse.
The supply cost to a store depends on the warehouse. The objective is to determine which
warehouses to open, and which of these warehouses should supply the various stores, such
that the sum of the maintenance and supply costs is minimized.
