diagnosis

Model-based diagnosis can be seen as taking as input a partially parameterized
structural description of a system and a set of observations about that system.
Its output is a set of assumptions which, together with the structural
description, logically imply the observations, or that are consistent with the
observations.

Diagnosis is usually applied to combinational digital circuits, seen as
black-boxes where there is a set of controllable input bits but only a set of
primary outputs is visible.

The problem is to find the set S of all (minimal) internal faults that explain
an incorrect output vector F (different than the modelled, predicted, output
vector N), given some input vector I.

The possible faults consider the usual stuck-at fault model, where faulty
circuit gates can be either stuck-at-0 or stuck-at-1, respectively outputting
value 0 or 1 independently of the input.

The diagnosis problem becomes more complex when the minimal internal
malfunction is not a single fault, but rather a set of faulty gates (double
faults, triple faults, and so on), with complexity increasing with the
cardinality of such set. We may also want to explicitly find (e.g.) double
faults instead of single faults to make a problem harder.
