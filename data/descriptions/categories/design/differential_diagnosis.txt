differential diagnosis

When the output of some system does not correspond to its expected behaviour
for a given input, one is faced with the problem of diagnosis. We are
    particularly concerned with digital circuits where only the circuitsï¿½ input
    and output may be observed.

Given a set of possible faults, we want to differentiate them in order to find
the real one affecting the circuit. For that, we may perform pairwise
differentiations between 2 diagnoses (2 sets of faults - usually 2 single
faults) d1,d2, by generating an input vector Id1,d2 that would entail an output
vector Od1 under diagnosis d1 (i.e. with faults d1 really present in the
circuit), and an output vector Od2 under diagnosis d2, with Od1 different than
Od2. Applying such input Id1,d2 to the circuit, at least one of the 2 diagnoses
will be discarded by checking the output.

Differential diagnosis thus consists in finding such a differentiating test
vector, or concluding that none exists (in which case we say that the two
diagnoses are indistinguishable).  (As usual, faulty circuit gates are either
stuck-at-0 or stuck-at-1, respectively outputting value 0 or 1 independently of
the input.)
