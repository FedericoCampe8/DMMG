The deck area is rectangular. Containers are cuboid, and are laid out in a single layer. All containers are positioned parallel to the sides of the deck. The contents of the containers determine their class. Certain classes of containers are constrained to be separated by minimum distances either along the deck or across the deck. The vessel loading decision problem is to determine whether a given set of containers can be positioned on a given deck, without overlapping, and without violating any of the separation constraints.
