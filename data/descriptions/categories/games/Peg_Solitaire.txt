Peg Solitaire

Peg Solitaire (also known as Hi-Q) is played on a board with a number of holes.
In the English version of the game, the board is in the shape of a cross with
33 holes:
  OOO
  OOO
OOOOOOO
OOOOOOO
OOOOOOO
  OOO
  OOO
Pegs (`X's here) are arranged on the board so that at least one hole remains. A
number of different problems arise from Solitaire, e.g. finding a path from the
initial to a goal state, or finding the shortest number of moves to a state
where no more moves are possible.  Moves are draughts/checkers-like and are
horizontal or vertical:

XX0 -> OOX
The following is the classic `central' version of the game:
Start:     Goal:
  XXX        OOO
  XXX        OOO
XXXXXXX    OOOOOOO
XXXOXXX -> OOOXOOO
XXXXXXX    OOOOOOO
  XXX        OOO
  XXX        OOO
The French version of the game has four extra holes:
  OOO
 OOOOO
OOOOOOO
OOOOOOO
OOOOOOO
 OOOOO
  OOO
Other board types, such as the Solitaire Triangle, also exist.
