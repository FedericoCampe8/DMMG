Balanced Academic Curriculum Problem (BACP)

The BACP is to design a balanced academic curriculum by assigning periods to
courses in a way that the academic load of each period is balanced, i.e., as
similar as possible . The curriculum must obey the following administrative and
academic regulations: 

Academic curriculum: an academic curriculum is defined by a set of courses and
a set of prerequisite relationships among them.  Number of periods: courses
must be assigned within a maximum number of academic periods.  Academic load:
each course has associated a number of credits or units that represent the
academic effort required to successfully follow it.  Prerequisites: some
courses can have other courses as prerequisites.  Minimum academic load: a
minimum number of academic credits per period is required to consider a student
as full time.  Maximum academic load: a maximum number of academic credits per
period is allowed in order to avoid overload.  Minimum number of courses: a
minimum number of courses per period is required to consider a student as full
time.  Maximum number of courses: a maximum number of courses per period is
allowed in order to avoid overload. 

The goal is to assign a period to every course in a way that the minimum and
maximum academic load for each period, the minimum and maximum number of
courses for each period, and the prerequisite relationships are satisfied. An
optimal balanced curriculum minimises the maximum academic load for all
periods.
