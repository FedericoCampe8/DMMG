The Rehearsal Problem

This problem originated at Lancaster University in the 1970s. It is reported to
have been devised by a member of staff in the Management Science department,
who was a member of an amateur orchestra and formalized the problem whilst
waiting to play during a rehearsal.  A concert is to consist of nine pieces of
music of different durations each involving a different combination of the five
members of the orchestra. Players can arrive at rehearsals immediately before
the first piece in which they are involved and depart immediately after the
last piece in which they are involved. The problem is to devise an order in
which the pieces can be rehearsed so as to minimize the total time that players
are waiting to play, i.e. the total time when players are present but not
currently playing.  In the table below, 1 indicates that the player is required
for the corresponding piece, 0 otherwise. The duration (i.e. time required to
rehearse each piece) is in some unspecified time units.
