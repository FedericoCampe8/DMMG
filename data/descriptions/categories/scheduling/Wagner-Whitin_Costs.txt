A Distribution Problem with Wagner-Whitin Costs

A basic distribution problem is described as follows. Given:
A supply chain structure of stocking points divided into L levels.
A holding cost (c) per unit of inventory at each stocking point, where it is
assumed that a parent has lower holding cost than any of its children.  A
procurement cost (c0) per stocking point (per order, not per unit of inventory
received).  A number of periods, T.  A demand for each leaf (A - C) at each
period.  Find an optimal ordering policy: i.e. a decision as to how much to
order at each stocking point at each time period that minimises cost.

The Wagner-Whitin form of the problem assumes that the holding costs and
procurement costs are constant, and that the demands are known for the entire
planning horizon. Furthermore, the stocking points have no maximum capacity and
the starting inventory is 0.
