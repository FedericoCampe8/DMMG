Bus driver scheduling can be formulated as a set paritioning problem. We
propose 12 set partitioning problems derived from small bus driver scheduling
problems. These consist of a given set of tasks (pieces of work) to cover and a
large set of possible shifts, where each shift covers a subset of the tasks and
has an associated cost. We must select a subset of possible shifts that covers
each piece of work once and only once: this is called a partition. Further, In
the driver scheduling (unlike air crew scheduling) the main aim is to reduce
the number of shifts used in the solution partition and the total cost of the
partition is secondary. To simplify the problem we have made the cost of each
shift the same. This means that the goal is to minimise the number of shifts.
