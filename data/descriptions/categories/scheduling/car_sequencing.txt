A number of cars are to be produced; they are not identical. The assembly line has different stations which install the various options. These stations have been designed to handle at most a certain percentage of the cars passing along the assembly line. Furthermore, the cars requiring a certain option must not be bunched together, otherwise the station will not be able to cope. The cars must be arranged in a sequence so that the capacity of each station is never exceeded.
