The problem is to timetable a party at a yacht club. Certain boats are to be designated hosts, and the crews of the remaining boats in turn visit the host boats for several successive half-hour periods. The crew of a host boat remains on board to act as hosts while the crew of a guest boat together visits several hosts. Every boat can only host a limited number of guests at a time and crew sizes are different.
