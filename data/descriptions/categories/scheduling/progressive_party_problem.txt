progressive party problem

The problem is to timetable a party at a yacht club. Certain boats are to be
designated hosts, and the crews of the remaining boats in turn visit the host
boats for several successive half-hour periods. The crew of a host boat remains
on board to act as hosts while the crew of a guest boat together visits several
hosts. Every boat can only host a limited number of guests at a time (its
capacity) and crew sizes are different. The table with boat capacities and crew
sizes can be found below; there were six time periods. A guest boat cannot not
revisit a host and guest crews cannot meet more than once. The problem facing
the rally organizer is that of minimizing the number of host boats.
