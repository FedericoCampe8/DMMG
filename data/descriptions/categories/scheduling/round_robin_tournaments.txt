round robin tournaments

The problem is to schedule a tournament of n teams over n-1 weeks, with each
week divided into n/2 periods, and each period divided into two slots. The
first team in each slot plays at home, whilst the second plays the first team
away. A tournament must satisfy the following three constraints: every team
plays once a week; every team plays at most twice in the same period over the
tournament; every team plays every other team.
One extension of the problem is to double round robin tournaments in which each
team plays every other team (as before) but now both at home and away. This is
often solved by repeating the round robin pattern, but swapping home games for
away games in the repeat.
