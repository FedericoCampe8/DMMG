The problem is to schedule a tournament of n teams over n-1 weeks, with each week divided into n/2 periods, and each period divided into two slots. The first team in each slot plays at home, whilst the second plays the first team away. 
Every team plays once a week; every team plays at most twice in the same period over the
tournament; every team plays every other team.
